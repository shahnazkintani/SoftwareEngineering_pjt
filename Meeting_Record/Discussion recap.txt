Good Shepherd Mission Project not viable
The organization only needs help with rearrangement and probably reconfiguration of some of their hardware components.
They noted that their current web page is fully functional and they are not willing to make any significant changes to it at the moment
My suggestion will be to explore the deep fake project or the GIS project since this organization does not seem to really need our help

#Suggestions on group project
#Discussions on possible language to implement project in
#Deadline of tuesday 2/5/19 to finalize on the actual project and discuss specifications/tools
#Decision on design & implementation strategy - (most likely incremental approach)
#Choice of web based or mobile app to be decided
